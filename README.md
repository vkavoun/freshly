# freshly

Experimental project bootstrapped with [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) [Fresh](https://github.com/denoland/fresh)

## hypothesis

I just bumped into `fresh` and I want to build something in a reasonable amount of time and have something. I am generally bad with scope creeping myself resulting in a lot of useful code but no real goal.

Version of Next.js 13.4.x is out now and I've played around with it and the new changes seem to be starting to stabilize. Right now `next.js` **vs** `deno` for me.

I am excited to find out how performant deno and fresh are. Obviously it's going to be pretty good considering that it's backed by `Preact` and the runtime is `Rust`.

In the end `Deno` i feel is for cloud/serverless/edge kind of deal while `Next.js` is doing something similar but different. So far the benchmarks have been similar performance from both but `Deno` has lower cost associated with it.
